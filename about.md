# Building & Learning

I'm a Computer Science & Business student at Lehigh University, where I blend technical expertise with business acumen. My journey spans from crafting AI models for environmental data to optimizing large-scale web applications in San Francisco's startup ecosystem.

# Technical Journey

My path in software engineering has been shaped by real-world challenges. At PairAnything, I transformed their WordPress infrastructure and built engaging user interfaces. With Studio Corsair, I dove deep into payment systems and e-commerce solutions. As an AI Research Fellow, I developed predictive models that made environmental data more accessible and actionable.
I recently completed a capstone project with Air Products, where I successfully bridged the gap between legacy Excel systems and modern Python applications, enhancing data accessibility for engineers worldwide. Currently, I am leveraging AI to develop practical solutions that address complex engineering challenges, further solidifying my expertise in creating innovative software solutions.

# Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, you'll find me:
- Playing chess (always up for a challenge)
- Improving my golf swing
- Contributing to open-source projects
- Exploring new technologies in AI and blockchain

# Let's Connect
