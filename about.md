# Building & Learning

I'm a Computer Science & Business student at Lehigh University, where I blend technical expertise with business acumen. My journey spans from crafting AI models for environmental data to optimizing large-scale web applications in San Francisco's startup ecosystem.

# Technical Journey

My path in software engineering has been shaped by real-world challenges. At PairAnything, I transformed their WordPress infrastructure and built engaging user interfaces. With Studio Corsair, I dove deep into payment systems and e-commerce solutions. As an AI Research Fellow, I developed predictive models that made environmental data more accessible and actionable.

Currently, I'm working with Air Products to bridge the gap between legacy Excel systems and modern Python applications, making complex data more accessible to engineers worldwide.

# Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, you'll find me:
- Playing chess (always up for a challenge)
- Improving my golf swing
- Contributing to open-source projects
- Exploring new technologies in AI and blockchain

# Let's Connect

I'm always excited to discuss technology, collaborate on projects, or share ideas about the future of software engineering. Feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas_atlas) or check out my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/NicAtlas).
