  <h1>General Information</h1>
  <p>Air pollution has been identified as one of the biggest threats to human health by the WHO Global Air Quality Guidelines, leading to respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. This project will implement innovative AI (Artificial Intelligence) techniques to provide fine-grained air quality sensing for residents in areas without air quality monitoring sensors.</p>

    <h3>Week One</h3>
    <p>I am very excited to start working on the Breath of The City Project. This is my first time working on a high impact project and I am motivated to put in the work. Me and my team work well together and I am happy to have them working alongside me.</p>
    <p>We have assigned roles and initiated research on the project. I will be focusing on the AI model. The AI model will need to predict air quality for any given location. The first step is determining which data affects air quality the most and will be utilized by the model. We need the model to incorporate spatial and temporal environment data. The spatial data being 
      details such as POIs (factories, buildings, plants), and road networks. The temporal details are details that is sequential and changes throughout time, the most prevalent temporal features are nearby air quality sensor records and nearby meterological data (temp, humidity, pressure, wind speed/direction, and weather). The type of model we are planning on implementing right now is a 
      LSTM-FCNs. Implementing an LSTM-FCN involves combining the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) architectures. This type of neural network combines the strengths of LSTM and CNN architectures. It can capture both temporal dependencies and spatial patterns, making it suitable for estimating air pollution based on both spatial and temporal data.
      We plan to extract both the static and sequential environment features from public API's to feed the model. I have spent a lot of time this week going through different API's documentation to see if it fits our needs. This involves checking the different payment plans, ensuring accurate data, ensuring consistant functionality, etc.</p>
    <p>This week was primarily a research week and we plan on sharing our findings with Professor Yang during our upcoming meeting with him next Monday. We have been finding and reading research papers that have similar goals as our project through Google Scholar. </p>
