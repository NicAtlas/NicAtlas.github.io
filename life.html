    <p>The Game of Life is a cellular automaton that simulates the life and death of cells in a grid. 
      The game is played on a two-dimensional grid, where each cell is either alive or dead. The cells 
      evolve over time, following a set of rules, which determine whether a cell lives or dies in the next 
      generation. The rules are based on the number of living cells in the surrounding cells of a given cell.
      In this particular implementation, cells are represented as squares on a canvas. You can select the starting point
      and then every transformation after follows a deterministic formula to expand and contract. If a cell has fewer than two or 
        more than three live neighbors, it dies of underpopulation or  overpopulation, respectively. If a dead cell 
        has exactly three live neighbors, it comes to life due to reproduction. The game continues to evolve with each new generation of cells, 
        creating visually interesting and complex patterns. Try some random starting positions out!</p>
