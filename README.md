# My Website

This repository is the home of my website portfolio. Enjoy!


## Development

Lanyon has two branches, but only one is used for active development.

- `master` for development.  **All pull requests should be to submitted against `master`.**
- `gh-pages` for our hosted site, which includes our analytics tracking code. **Please avoid using this branch.**
