title: Frontend Engineering at PairAnything
---

My internship at PairAnything in San Francisco has been an exciting journey into modern web development. As a Frontend Software Engineer, I've had the opportunity to work on significant infrastructure improvements and user experience enhancements.

One of my major contributions was leading the migration and optimization of their large-scale WordPress site. This involved careful planning and execution to ensure seamless data handling through custom plugin modifications.

I also developed a configurable, CMS-compatible interactive widget using React, which significantly improved user engagement. The implementation of API integrations for dynamic content display led to a 40% increase in user interaction.

This experience has deepened my understanding of frontend technologies and the importance of user-centric design in software development.
