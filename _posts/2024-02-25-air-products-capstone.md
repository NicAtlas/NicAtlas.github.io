title: Modernizing Legacy Systems at Air Products
---

As part of my capstone project at Lehigh University, I'm working with Air Products to bridge the gap between legacy Excel systems and modern Python applications. Our team of 5 engineers is developing a crucial internal tool that transforms complex Excel-based models into Python code.

The challenge lies in maintaining the accuracy and reliability of these business-critical models while making them more accessible and efficient. We've successfully implemented over 8 Excel functions and developed a RESTful API for the GREET1 2023 Model, significantly improving data processing capabilities.

This project has taught me valuable lessons about system modernization, team collaboration, and the importance of maintaining business continuity while implementing technical improvements.
