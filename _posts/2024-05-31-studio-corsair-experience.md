title: Building Payment Systems at Studio Corsair
---

At Studio Corsair, I had the opportunity to dive deep into payment processing systems and e-commerce solutions. The experience began with an intensive bootcamp where I mastered modern development tools including Jest, TypeScript, and Bash.

My main project involved implementing backend API methods for an internal payment application. Through careful optimization and efficient coding practices, we achieved a 50% improvement in transaction processing speed.

I also conducted market research and developed a prototype for automated drop shipping on Amazon Japan, combining technical skills with business strategy.
